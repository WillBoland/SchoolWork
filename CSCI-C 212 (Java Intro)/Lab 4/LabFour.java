 * 19:

 * if (n == 0) {
      b = false;
    }
    b = true;
 * 
 * CORRECT ANSWER: b = (n != 0);
 * 
 * This is most simplified because we are setting b (boolean) equal to eiter false if n == 0 or true if n != 0;

/*
 * 37:
 * 
 * MY ANSWER: Not Infinite
 * 
 * CORRECT ANSWER: Infinite
 * 
 * This is because i = i++ does NOT increment i until after we retrieve the i value. So we set i == to itself before incrementation
