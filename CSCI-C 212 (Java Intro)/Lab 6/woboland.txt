Lab 6 grading report
Graded at commit: 1eb37c7c

Four equally weighted parts:
A) Final program works properly
B) Implementation of java.util.Arrays.sort    (int[])
C) Implementation of java.util.Arrays.toString(int[])
D) Implementation of java.util.Arrays.copyOf  (int[], int)

sort, toString, and copyOf are graded on conformance to Javadoc (linked to in
	lab assignment page on course website).
For B and D (sort and copyOf), the reference (java.util.Arrays) implementation
	throws a NullPointerException if given a null array as its input. Ideally,
	your program would also do this, but I did not take off points if it didn't.


==========   A   ==========
Program stores numbers until user enters "bye"  :
Program handles "bye" as first input            : -0.5 see 2 lines down â†“
Program prints array after every input          :
Program prints sorted array after "bye"         : -1 prints garbage after Bye

==========   B   ========== (sort)
Handles arrays of length 0                      :
Sorts array into ascending numerical order      :
Sorts inplace instead of making new array       :
Doesn't unsort already-sorted arrays            :

==========   C   ========== (toString)
Returns "null" on null input                    : NullPointerException
Returns "[]" on empty input                     :
Returns String of correct format ("[-1, 2, -3]"):
Returned String does not contain a trailing ", ":

==========   D   ========== (copyOf)
Handles input arrays of length 0                :
Returns copy of new length                      :
Truncates to length if necessary                :
Pads with zeroes if necessary                   :


===========================
A (out of 4): -1.5
B (out of 4):
C (out of 4): -1
D (out of 4):
Total = (A + B + C + D) / 16 = 14.5/16

Total: 90.63

========   NOTES   ========
This may or may not apply to you:
  sort() should sort the array inplace and *return nothing*.
  public void sort(int[] a)
