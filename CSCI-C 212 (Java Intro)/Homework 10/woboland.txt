Homework 10 grading report
Graded at commit: 

As always, I grade based off of Professor German's instructions. For hw 10:
33% for each part of the problem:
1) P16.9  - make LispList interface + 2 implementations
            methods empty(), head(), tail(), cons()
              empty list: throw UnsupportedOperationException for head and tail
            public static final LispList NIL = new EmptyList()
2) P16.10 - method length()
3) P16.12 - method contains(Object obj)
              "returns true if the list contains an element that *equals* obj"

Final grade: 100

Deductions/notes:



If you have any questions, my office hours are MW 4:15-5:45 @ Luddy 2010.
Or, email me at sraizada@iu.edu if it's something simple.

========   NOTES   ========
contains() should check for null variable before calling .equals(), otherwise it
  may throw a NullPointerException

if (head == null) return o == null; // still return true if both are null
return head.equals(o) || tail.contains(o);
