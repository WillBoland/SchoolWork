1: The nunchuck is via I2C; does not need to initialize pins because of this.

2: I2C Read passes in a register among other things; yet Nunchuck Read does not. This implies the nunchuck is using only what it requires once it starts communicating.

3: 
ax = Accel X-Axis
ay = Accel Y-Axis
az = Accel Z-Axis
jx = Joystick X-Axis
jy = Joystick Y-Axis
c = C Button
z = Z Button

4:
	2: Z is held down, c is not
	1: Z is not, C is held down
	0: Z and c are held down
	3: z and C are NOT held down

Difficulties: I only had the nunchuck for about an hour. This was because of a family emergency. This made it difficult to finish, as I only got the bare bone stuff down with it. Most of the code was written without testing (because I didnt have a nunchuck or the board).
