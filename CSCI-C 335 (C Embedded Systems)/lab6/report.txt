1: Printf debugging is alright for tracking down minor issues and double confirming values. The downside is that if you have something in a loop, it becomes very hard to track.

2: It is called so the LCD knows what to set each pixel to.

3: It sets Port B pin 12 Pin high. This is so theres nothing communicating during our initialization phase. This would cause issues.

4: Every column can be represented by a byte. This allows the function to turn a pixel on or off based off of the contents of that byte. This leads to having a number of columns where it is set the corresponding bits in each to form a character.

5: It is faster because it doesn't loop over every single pixel, but "pushes larger blocks of color to the screen."
   Originally, it looped over every single pixel setting the value. Now we push large blocks. This more than doubled the speed.

Difficulties:  Just making sure to not fry my board. I really liked this lab, it brought multiple pieces together.
