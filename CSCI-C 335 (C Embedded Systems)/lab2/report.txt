Results:
I accomplished everything assigned. 
At first, my makefile did not seem to work. I forgot to put in a (.
What also didn't work was type casting inside of dump.c. 
I forgot to typecast it into a pointer.
Overall, everything worked well.

Difficulties:
The spacing during the dump. 
I realized that it would not line up exactly if I used the format I did to print the top.
So, I customized each spacing to better match what the top printed. 
Overall, it wasn't complex.

What I Learned:
I learned certain shortcuts you can take while making a Makefile.
I also learned the usefullness of macros.
I also learned some formatting tricks; however, I knew most of them already.
Overall, it was helpful refresher.
