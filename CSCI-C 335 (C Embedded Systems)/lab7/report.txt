1) It has 14 pins.
   1: Vdd_IO
   2: SCL
   3: SDA
   4: INT2
   5: INT1
   6: C1
   7: GND
   8: Reserved
   9: DRDY
   10: Reserved
   11: Reserved
   12: SETP
   13: SETC
   14: Vdd
  
   The minimum amount of voltage is 2.16. The max is 3.6.
   

2) We write to the accelerometer and magnetometer before we read them because we need to initialize the values.
   Given the way i2c protocal works, we need to write bytes before we can read so we have something to read initially.
   The following lines write to the slave devices so we have an initial value to read from for the master device.

3) It takes the given array pointer and writes in indices 0, 1, and 2 the corresponding accelerometer data.
   For example, [0] = x; [1] = y; [2] = z
   It does this by looping 3 times, and taking our buffer at a specific position and left shifting 8 bits.

4) It might be necessary to tilt compensate the compass given how if I tilt the board, my roll and pitch affect the reading.
   This is because of the way we calculate the current heading using pitch and roll as base points. If it is tilted, our base points are off.

Difficulties/What did I learn:	 Overall this lab was fairly easy. I had issues finding a good range for my heading.
		      		 I learned about i2c communication.
