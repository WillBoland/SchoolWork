How many connections are required to communicate over UART?

    2

What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?

     to provide more functionality and so we don't end up with a lot of pins

Define "baud rate" in your own words.

       how many bits (per second) we can transfer

Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf() won't work on the board without it?

    it does not depend on the operating system, unlike printf (after including stdio.h) which isnt always on what we are running on

Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.

     Included screenshot; it is helpful for when we can not print to screen. NOTE: setting to ASCII did not work

What did I learn?

     I learned about how to interact with the UART and a better understanding overall.
     I had a problem not seeing my input, but then I switched the wires
