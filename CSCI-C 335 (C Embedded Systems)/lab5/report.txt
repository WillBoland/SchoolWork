1.What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
       It lets us talk with peripherals/connected devices

2.Why  do  you  set  the  CS  high  at  the  end  of  the  pin  initializations?  What  other  function in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
       Set it high to signify end of communication. f3d_gyro_write and f3d_gyro_read set it high to low/low to high

3.How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
       Gyro was already connected. We could use additional wiring for other peripherals for one SPI bus


4.The STM  has  an  Operating  Frequency  of  72  MHz.  When  initializing  SPI1,  what  do  you  set  the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
      SPI_BaudRatePrescaler_8. So 8. The SPI clock frequency is 9MHz (72/8)


5.Does  a  peripheral  (slave)  need  to  be  configured  with  the  transmission  speed  before  it  can  communicate with the microcontroller (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly change in transmission speed?
	Yes. We want to make on-the-fly changes so we can talk with other peripherals that need a certain speed


Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had [5]
	 I learned about SPI communication as well as different peripherals we hacve access to.
	 I had difficulty getting the Logic Analyzer to work.
