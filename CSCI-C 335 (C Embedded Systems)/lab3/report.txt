1. What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?

   Speed: 50MHz
   RAM:	  40k X 8
   Flash: 256 KB

2. What does GPIO stand for?

   General Purpose Input Output

3. Is the provided delay function accurate? Why or why not?

   It is fairly accurate; however, since it is in a for loop it is not exact.

4. What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two green LEDs?

   PE15 and PE11

5. What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?

   uint32_t GPIO_Pin;              
   GPIOMode_TypeDef GPIO_Mode;     
   GPIOSpeed_TypeDef GPIO_Speed;
   GPIOOType_TypeDef GPIO_OType;   
   GPIOPuPd_TypeDef GPIO_PuPd;   


Difficulties:
	Not too many. Just when it got to the very end.
	I learned a lot about how we can interact with the board.
