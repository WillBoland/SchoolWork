# INSTRUCTIONS

When you compile, please make sure to compile both conversions.c and CurrencyConversion.c
This can be accomplished by executing: 
## gcc conversions.c CurrencyConversion.c.
This is so it will work include both required files. The main function is CurrencyConversion.c where conversions.c is just function definitions.
